# A retrospective on day 1

Long story short I'm just happy that I managed to get it to work, I've batted my head up against Haskell a bunch of times and have never actually solved a PROBLEM with it so to manage that today was pretty cool.

This was honestly pretty hard and the up front research to manage this was pretty difficult and led to like
- Lambda calculus
- Currying
- Monads 

and a few other things because I wanted to actually understand what each line of code was doing. Also the solution for p1 is fine, but I'm pretty sure the solution for p2 is O(n*m) where n and m are the sizes of the two lists which is bad. Could be improved by creating a map of the frequency of each value in list B rather than filtering each time but I wanted to do it this way bc its what made sense in my brain so :)
